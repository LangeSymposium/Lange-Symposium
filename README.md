# 2024 Lange Symposium on Computational & Statistical Genomics

## January 26, 2024 at UCLA

**8:30 am - 4:00 pm**

The Fourth Annual Lange Symposium was held January 26. 2024. This year's topic was *Computational & Statistical Genomics*. This annual event is hosted by the UCLA Departments of Computational Medicine and Human Genetics, and supported in part by a grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute; R25 HG011845. The Annual Lange Symposium was launched in 2020 to honor UCLA Professor and National Academy of Sciences Fellow Kenneth Lange. The event celebrates the impact of Dr. Lange’s research, mentorship, and teaching over the course of an illustrious career spanning more than four decades.

### Diversity Travel Awards
<span style="color:red">*Application closed*</span>

Each year we offer travel awards for attendees who will further the goal of increasing the diversity of the biomedical workforce. This includes persons from historically underrepresented groups (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, and persons with disabilities). You may also apply if you are faculty from an advanced degree granting institution with a high enrollment of underrepresented minority students, who would be interested in partnering with UCLA faculty to make symposium and workshop material available to their students.

Travel awards cover travel within the U.S., meals, and lodging.
