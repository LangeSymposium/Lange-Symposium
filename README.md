## January 27, 2025 at UCLA

**8:30 am - 4:00 pm**

The Fifth Annual Lange Symposium was held January 27, 2025. This year's topic was *Computational Statistics*. This annual event is hosted by the UCLA Departments of Computational Medicine and Human Genetics, and supported in part by a grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute; R25 HG011845. The Annual Lange Symposium was launched in 2020 to honor UCLA Professor and National Academy of Sciences Fellow Kenneth Lange. The event celebrates the impact of Dr. Lange’s research, mentorship, and teaching over the course of an illustrious career spanning more than four decades.

### Travel Awards
Our travel award program solicits applications from around the country from scientists and trainees who would be otherwise unable to attend. You may also apply if you are faculty from an advanced degree granting institution with a high enrollment of students who would benefit from access to this material, who would be interested in partnering with UCLA faculty to make symposium and workshop material available to their students.
Travel awards cover travel within the U.S., meals, and lodging.
