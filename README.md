*The next Lange Symposium will be held at UCLA in early 2024. Watch this space for details.*

## Annual Lange Symposium on Genomics & Computational Statistics for Big Data

The Departments of Computational Medicine and Human Genetics in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA host an annual Lange Symposium on Genomics and Computational Statistics for Big Data in honor of UCLA Professor and National Academy of Sciences Fellow Kenneth Lange. Professor Lange is an internationally recognized mathematical biologist with an illustrious career spanning more than four decades. He is, perhaps, best known for his seminal contributions to human genetics, but also more generally for his development of computational algorithms applied to many disciplines, ranging from biomedical imaging to neuroscience. Professor Lange has been a devoted advisor to many PhD students in Biomathematics, Biostatistics, and Human Genetics and has taught scores of students aspiring to enter the field of computational biology, including many leaders in the field. He continues to mentor and inspire students who combine mathematical talent with biological curiosity.

This annual event was launched in 2020, and is supported in part by a grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute; R25 HG011845.

### Diversity Travel Awards

To honor Professor Lange's committment to diversity in biomedical research, each year we offer travel awards for attendees who will further the goal of increasing the diversity of the biomedical workforce. This includes persons from historically underrepresented groups (i.e., racial and ethnic minorities, first-generation college students, and persons with disabilities). You may also apply if you are faculty from an advanced degree granting institution with a high enrollment of underrepresented minority students, who would be interested in partnering with UCLA faculty to make symposium and workshop material available to their students. 

Travel awards cover travel within the U.S., meals, and lodging. For more information contact [Jeanette Papp](mailto:jcpapp@ucla.edu?subject=Lange_Symposium_2023)
